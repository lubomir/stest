# STest

STest is a simple testing utility for checking output of command line programs.
All tests are defined in many files. All files of one test have same base name
and their extensions determine what the particular file tests. Default location
for these files is a tests/ subdirectory.

.in     gets passed to standard input
.args   contains command line arguments
.out    is expected on standard output
.err    is expected on standard error output
.ret    contains expected exit code

Use the gen-test utility to easily generate these tests. Both gen-test and
stest have some help available with --help option.

# Requirements

Build dependencies of stest are a C compiler, Cutter unit testing library and
libtool. All these dependencies should be checked for by configure script.

There are also runtime dependecies: diff and optionally Valgrind for checking
memory errors.

# Building

In source directory, run

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

# TODO

 + test program via custom command (.cmd)
 + enable execution of a script before and after test (.pre, .post)

 + allow building without tests
 + only print one header for one failed test
 + proper plurals in messages: contexts, lines
